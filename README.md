## Dummy DB plugin for the Bitfinex Honey Framework

This plugin is meant to be used when no exchange-specific methods are required by a running instance of the `bfx-hf-models` database. It implements the required methods as stubs.

See `examples/basic_hf_db.js` to get a `bfx-hf-models` instance running with no exchange-specific methods.
